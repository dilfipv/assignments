<p>A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out arbitrary sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs, enables them to perform an extremely wide range of tasks.</p>
<a id="cpu"></a>
<h4>CPU</h4>
<p>A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since the early 1960s.</p>

<h4><a id="alu" ></a>ALU</h4>
<p>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers. This is in contrast to a floating-point unit (FPU), which operates on floating point numbers. An ALU is a fundamental building block of many types of computing circuits, including the central processing unit (CPU) of computers, FPUs, and graphics processing units (GPUs). A single CPU, FPU or GPU may contain multiple ALUs.</p>

<H2>Programming Language</H2>
<a href="#top">Go to top</a>
<p>A programming language is a formal languge designed to communicate instructions to a machine, perticularly a computer. programming language can be used to create programs that control behaviour of a machine and /orto express alogorithem percisly</p>
<a id="c"></a>

<h4>C</h4>
<p>C (/siː/, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations.</p>

<h4><a id="c++" ></a>C++</h4>
<p>C++ (/ˌsiːˌplʌsˈplʌs/ "cee plus plus") is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.</p>
